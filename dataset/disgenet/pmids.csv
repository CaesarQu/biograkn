21826607,Beyond BRAF in melanoma.,"Recent progress in the analysis of genetic alterations in melanoma has identified recurrent mutations that result in the activation of critical signaling pathways promoting growth and survival of tumors cells. Alterations in the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase and PI3-kinase signaling pathways are commonly altered in melanoma. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and GNAQ occur in a mutually exclusive pattern and lead to MAP-kinase activation. Loss of PTEN function, primarily by deletion, is the most common known genetic alteration in the PI3-kinase cascade, and is commonly associated with BRAF mutations (Curtin et al., N Engl J Med 353:2135-2147, 2005; Tsao et al., Cancer Res 60:1800-1804, 2000, J Investig Dermatol 122:337-341, 2004). The growth advantage conveyed by the constitutive activation of these pathways leads to positive selection of cells that have acquired the mutations and in many instances leads to critical dependency of the cancer cells on their activation. This creates opportunities for therapeutic interventions targeted at signaling components within these pathways that are amenable for pharmacological inhibition. This concept follows the paradigm established by the landmark discovery that inhibition of the fusion kinase BCR-ABL can be used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (Druker et al., N Engl J Med 344:1031-037, 2001). The review will focus primarily on kinases involved in signaling that are currently being evaluated for therapeutic intervention in melanoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21826607
25646931,Prenylation inhibition-induced cell death in melanoma: reduced sensitivity in BRAF mutant/PTEN wild-type melanoma cells.,"While targeted therapy brought a new era in the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma, therapeutic options for non-BRAF mutant cases are still limited. In order to explore the antitumor activity of prenylation inhibition we investigated the response to zoledronic acid treatment in thirteen human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF, NRAS and PTEN mutational status. Effect of zoledronic acid on proliferation, clonogenic potential, apoptosis and migration of melanoma cells as well as the activation of downstream elements of the RAS/RAF pathway were investigated in vitro with SRB, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays and videomicroscopy and immunoblot measurements, respectively. Subcutaneous and spleen-to-liver colonization xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the influence of zoledronic acid treatment on primary and disseminated tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Zoledronic acid more efficiently decreased short-term in vitro viability in NRAS mutant cells when compared to BRAF mutant and BRAF/NRAS wild-type cells. In line with this finding, following treatment decreased activation of ribosomal protein S6 was found in NRAS mutant cells. Zoledronic acid demonstrated no significant synergism in cell viability inhibition or apoptosis induction with cisplatin or DTIC treatment in vitro. Importantly, zoledronic acid could inhibit clonogenic growth in the majority of melanoma cell lines except in the three BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines. A similar pattern was observed in apoptosis induction experiments. In vivo zoledronic acid did not inhibit the subcutaneous growth or spleen-to-liver colonization of melanoma cells. Altogether our data demonstrates that prenylation inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach in NRAS mutant melanoma. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that therapeutic sensitivity might be influenced by the PTEN status of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. However, further investigations are needed to identify drugs that have appropriate pharmacological properties to efficiently target prenylation in melanoma cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646931
24201813,AEBP1 upregulation confers acquired resistance to BRAF (V600E) inhibition in melanoma.,"An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib, potent and selective inhibitors of mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), exhibit remarkable activities in patients with V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after the initial treatment. Identification of acquired resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term responses of melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. Here we report that increased expression of AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1) confers acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma. AEBP1 is shown to be highly upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells because of the hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. This upregulates AEBP1 expression and thus leads to the activation of NF-κB via accelerating IκBa degradation. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway greatly reverses the PLX4032-resistant phenotype of melanoma cells. Furthermore, increased expression of AEBP1 is validated in post-treatment tumors in patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Therefore, these results reveal a novel PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway whose activation contributes to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition, and suggest that this pathway, particularly AEBP1, may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24201813
25915038,"Activating the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway for the Treatment of Melanoma--Application of LY2090314, a Novel Selective Inhibitor of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3.","It has previously been observed that a loss of β-catenin expression occurs with melanoma progression and that nuclear β-catenin levels are inversely proportional to cellular proliferation, suggesting that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may provide benefit for melanoma patients. In order to further probe this concept we tested LY2090314, a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor with activity against GSK3α and GSK3β isoforms. In a panel of melanoma cell lines, nM concentrations of LY2090314 stimulated TCF/LEF TOPFlash reporter activity, stabilized β-catenin and elevated the expression of Axin2, a Wnt responsive gene and marker of pathway activation. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that melanoma cell lines are very sensitive to LY2090314 in vitro (IC50 ~10 nM after 72hr of treatment) in contrast to other solid tumor cell lines (IC50 >10 uM) as evidenced by caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Cell lines harboring mutant B-RAF or N-RAS were equally sensitive to LY2090314 as were those with acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib. shRNA studies demonstrated that β-catenin stabilization is required for apoptosis following treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor since the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to LY290314 could be overcome by β-catenin knockdown. We further demonstrate that in vivo, LY2090314 elevates Axin2 gene expression after a single dose and produces tumor growth delay in A375 melanoma xenografts with repeat dosing. The activity of LY2090314 in preclinical models suggests that the role of Wnt activators for the treatment of melanoma should be further explored.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915038
24362263,MEK-dependent negative feedback underlies BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction.,"The clinical experience with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) provides compelling evidence for oncogene addiction. Yet, the molecular basis of oncogene addiction remains elusive. Through unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of CML cells transiently exposed to BCR-ABL TKI, we identified persistent downregulation of growth factor receptor (GF-R) signaling pathways. We then established and validated a tissue-relevant isogenic model of BCR-ABL-mediated addiction, and found evidence for myeloid GF-R signaling pathway rewiring that profoundly and persistently dampens physiologic pathway activation. We demonstrate that eventual restoration of ligand-mediated GF-R pathway activation is insufficient to fully rescue cells from a competing apoptotic fate. In contrast to previous work with BRAF(V600E) in melanoma cells, feedback inhibition following BCR-ABL TKI treatment is markedly prolonged, extending beyond the time required to initiate apoptosis. Mechanistically, BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is facilitated by persistent high levels of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK)-dependent negative feedback. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that BCR–ABL can confer addiction in vitro by rewiring myeloid GF-R signaling through establishment of MEK-dependent negative feedback. Our findings predict that deeper, more durable responses to targeted agents across a range of malignancies may be facilitated by maintaining negative feedback concurrently with oncoprotein inhibition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362263
21356389,Mutant IDH1 confers an in vivo growth in a melanoma cell line with BRAF mutation.,"Melanoma is the most deadly tumor of the skin, and systemic therapies for the advanced stage are still limited. Recent genetic analyses have revealed the molecular diversity of melanoma and potential therapeutic targets. By screening a cohort of 142 primary nonepithelial tumors, we discovered that about 10% of melanoma cases (4/39) harbored an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. These mutations were found to coexist with BRAF or KIT mutation, and all IDH1 mutations were detected in metastatic lesions. BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, additionally expressing the cancer-related IDH1 mutant, acquired increased colony-forming and in vivo growth activities and showed enhanced activation of the MAPK and STAT3 pathways. Genome-wide gene expression profiling demonstrated that mutant IDH1 affected the expression of a set of genes. Especially, it caused the induction of growth-related transcriptional regulators (Jun, N-myc, Atf3) and the reduction of Rassf1 and two dehydrogenase genes (Dhrs1 and Adh5), which may be involved in the carcinogenesis of IDH1-mutated tumors. Our analyses demonstrate that IDH1 mutation works with other oncogenic mutations and could contribute to the metastasis in melanoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21356389
25407517,"A primary melanoma and its asynchronous metastasis highlight the role of BRAF, CDKN2A, and TERT.","BACKGROUND: Alterations in pathways including BRAF, CDKN2A, and TERT contribute to the development of melanoma, but the sequence in which the genetic alterations occur and their prognostic significance remains unclear. To clarify the role of these pathways, we analyzed a primary melanoma and its metastasis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for BRAF-V600E, Sanger sequencing of BRAF and the TERT promoter, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and telomere analyses were performed on a primary melanoma and its asynchronous cerebellar metastasis. Using the log-rank test and Cox-proportional model, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort of melanomas was analyzed for the effect of BRAF mutation and CDKN2A loss on survival. RESULTS: The primary melanoma expressed mutant BRAF-V600E and possessed a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. In addition to these early defects, the metastatic lesion also possessed evidence of aneuploidy and an activating mutation of the TERT promoter. In the TCGA melanoma cohort, there was a non-significant trend toward poor prognosis in early stage cutaneous melanoma patients with concomitant BRAF mutation and CDKN2A loss. CONCLUSION: BRAF mutation and CDKN2A loss occurred early and TERT promoter mutation later in a case of lethal metastatic melanoma. The effects of these pathways on survival warrant further investigation in early stage cutaneous melanoma patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407517
24884503,Large-scale label-free comparative proteomics analysis of polo-like kinase 1 inhibition via the small-molecule inhibitor BI 6727 (Volasertib) in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells.,"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role during the cell cycle by regulating mitotic entry, progression, and exit. Plk1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and is essential to sustained oncogenic proliferation, thus making Plk1 an attractive therapeutic target. However, the clinical efficacy of Plk1 inhibition has not emulated the preclinical success, stressing an urgent need for a better understanding of Plk1 signaling. This study addresses that need by utilizing a quantitative proteomics strategy to compare the proteome of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells following treatment with the Plk1-specific inhibitor BI 6727. Employing label-free nano-LC-MS/MS technology on a Q-exactive followed by SIEVE processing, we identified more than 20 proteins of interest, many of which have not been previously associated with Plk1 signaling. Here we report the down-regulation of multiple metabolic proteins with an associated decrease in cellular metabolism, as assessed by lactate and NAD levels. Furthermore, we have also identified the down-regulation of multiple proteasomal subunits, resulting in a significant decrease in 20S proteasome activity. Additionally, we have identified a novel association between Plk1 and p53 through heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC), thus providing valuable insight into Plk1's role in cancer cell survival.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884503
25256614,The immune microenvironment confers resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors through macrophage-derived TNFα.,"Recently, the rationale for combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy has come to light, but our understanding of the immune response during MAPK pathway inhibitor treatment is limited. We discovered that the immune microenvironment can act as a source of resistance to MAPK pathway-targeted therapy, and moreover during treatment this source becomes reinforced. In particular, we identified macrophage-derived TNFα as a crucial melanoma growth factor that provides resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors through the lineage transcription factor MITF (microphthalmia transcription factor). Most strikingly, in BRAF-mutant melanomas of patients and BRAF(V600E) melanoma allografts, MAPK pathway inhibitors increased the number of tumor-associated macrophages, and TNFα and MITF expression. Inhibiting TNFα signaling with IκB kinase inhibitors profoundly enhanced the efficacy of MAPK pathway inhibitors by targeting not only the melanoma cells but also the microenvironment. In summary, we identify the immune microenvironment as a novel source of resistance and reveal a new strategy to improve the efficacy of targeted therapy in melanoma. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies the immune microenvironment as a source of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors through macrophage-derived TNFα, and reveals that in patients on treatment this source becomes reinforced. Inhibiting IκB kinase enhances the efficacy of MAPK pathway inhibitors, which identifies this approach as a potential novel strategy to improve targeted therapy in melanoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25256614
22554099,The role of BRAF V600 mutation in melanoma.,"BRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase activating the MAP kinase/ERK-signaling pathway. About 50 % of melanomas harbors activating BRAF mutations (over 90 % V600E). BRAFV600E has been implicated in different mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis, most of which due to the deregulated activation of the downstream MEK/ERK effectors. The first selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF, vemurafenib, after highly encouraging results of the phase I and II trial, was compared to dacarbazine in a phase III trial in treatment-naïve patients (BRIM-3). The study results showed a relative reduction of 63 % in risk of death and 74 % in risk of tumor progression. Considering all trials so far completed, median overall survival reached approximately 16 months for vemurafenib compared to less than 10 months for dacarbazine treatment. Vemurafenib has been extensively tested on melanoma patients expressing the BRAFV600E mutated form; it has been demonstrated to be also effective in inhibiting melanomas carrying the V600K mutation. In 2011, both FDA and EMA therefore approved vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma carrying BRAFV600 mutations. Some findings suggest that continuation of vemurafenib treatment is potentially beneficial after local therapy in a subset of patients with disease progression (PD). Among who continued vemurafenib >30 days after local therapy of PD lesion(s), a median overall survival was not reached, with a median follow-up of 15.5 months from initiation of BRAFinhibitor therapy. For patients who did not continue treatment, median overall survival from the time of disease progression was 1.4 months. A clinical phase I/II trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor mAb ipilimumab. In the BRIM-7 trial vemurafenib is tested in association with GDC-0973, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2. Preliminary data seem to indicate that an additional inhibitor of mutated BRAF, GSK2118436, might be also active on a wider range of BRAFmutations (V600E-K-D-R); actually, treatment with such a compound is under evaluation in a phase III study among stage III-IV melanoma patients positive for BRAF mutations. Overall, BRAF inhibitors were well tolerated; common adverse events are arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea, with some variants between different inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554099
23651150,Detection of BRAF p.V600E Mutations in Melanoma by Immunohistochemistry Has a Good Interobserver Reproducibility.,"CONTEXT: Assessment of BRAF p.V600E mutational status has become necessary for treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Detection of p.V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry was recently reported in several tumor types. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interobserver reproducibility of BRAF p.V600E detection by immunohistochemistry in melanoma. DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry with VE1 antibody was performed on metastatic melanomas of 67 patients. Staining interpretation was performed on digital image virtual slides of tissue microarrays. The p.V600E status was determined by 7 pathologists from 3 European laboratories, blinded for other interpretations and for molecular biology results. RESULTS: Melanomas had p.V600E (n = 30), p.V600K (n = 4), p.K601E (n = 1), p.600-601delinsE (n = 1), or no p.V600 mutations (n = 31). Staining of p.V600E within mutated cells was cytoplasmic and diffuse, and for each case the staining on the 3 tissue microarray cores was similar. In 53 cases (79.1%) the 7 pathologists had perfect concordance. Agreement of interobserver reproducibility was almost perfect (κ = 0.81 [0.77-0.85]). Only 2 false-positive responses (0.9%) were obtained. The specificities reported were 100% for 5 pathologists (two of whom previously trained for p.V600E interpretation), and 97% for 2 untrained pathologists. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of BRAF p.V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry in melanomas has an excellent interobserver reproducibility. Our results suggest that immunohistochemistry could be used as a first step for detection of BRAF p.V600E mutation, to identify patients with melanoma as candidates for BRAF inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651150
26643848,Clinicopathological characteristics associated with BRAF(K601E) and BRAF(L597) mutations in melanoma.,"BRAF mutations at codons L597 and K601 occur uncommonly in melanoma. Clinical and pathological associations of these mutations were investigated in a cohort of 1119 patients with known BRAF mutation status. A BRAF mutation was identified in 435 patients; Mutations at L597 and the K601E mutation were seen in 3.4 and 3.2% of these, respectively. K601E melanomas tended to occur in male patients, a median age of 58 yr, were generally found on the trunk (64%) and uncommonly associated with chronically sun-damaged (CSD) skin. BRAFL597 melanomas occurred in older patients (median 66 yr), but were associated with CSD skin (extremities or head and neck location - 73.3%, P = 0.001). Twenty-three percent of patients with V600E- and 43% of patients with K601E-mutant melanomas presented with nodal disease at diagnosis compared to just 14% of patients with BRAF wild-type tumors (P = 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Overall, these mutations represent a significant minority of BRAF mutations, but have distinct clinicopathological phenotypes and clinical behaviors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26643848
